### The task involves creating an interactive web page for a snack restaurant where users can place their orders. The user will be prompted to enter their name and gender, receive a personalized welcome message, and then choose their preferred meal from the menu. The program will confirm their order, display a preparation message, and log their name and order in the console. Additionally, you are tasked with implementing a feature where a number input is mapped to its corresponding word (e.g., 1 â†’ "ONE") and display a default message for invalid inputs.
